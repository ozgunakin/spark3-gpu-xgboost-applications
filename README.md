# Spark3 GPU XGboost Applications

## Download the Datasets and the Application Files.

We will use mortgage, agaricus and taxi datasets for XGboost examples. All datasets and jupyter notebooks are placed in this repository.&#x20;

* [x] Clone this repository to /opt/xgboost directory.

```
cd /opt/xgboost

git clone https://github.com/ozgunakin/spark3-gpu-nvidia-rapidsai-setup-on-aws-ec2.git

cd spark3-gpu-nvidia-rapidsai-setup-on-aws-ec2/dataset

#EXTRACT AGARICUS FILES
tar -xvf agaricus-small.tar

#EXTRACT MORTGATE FILES
tar -xvf mortgage-small-2.tar

#EXTRACT TAXI FILES
tar -xvf taxi-small.tar
```

## GPU Based XGBoost Applications

You can find notebooks for XGBoost applications designed by using three different datasets in the notebooks directory of the repository that we have downloaded in the previous section.

* [ ] Open Jupyter Notebook in /opt/xgboost directory.
